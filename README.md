# Band Kungfu

**Band Kungfu** is a browser based voxel crowd brawler. Choose one of four fighters, battle through the Grand Arena, defeat 1,000 challengers and four masters, and claim the tournament title. Practice mode has endless waves.

The game uses Three.js and a fixed 60 Hz simulation. Its browser code is served as ES modules without a build step. Desktop keyboard, gamepad, and landscape touch controls are supported.

## Play locally

Requires Node.js 22.9 or newer and a WebGL2 browser.

```sh
npm ci
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The server listens on `127.0.0.1`. You can play without a BAND account; the result screen only offers the BAND button when the relay is configured.

## BAND AI run analyst

A completed run can be sent to a [BAND](https://band.ai/) room from the result screen. The **Game Reporter** agent posts the run summary and mentions the **Run Analyst** agent, which replies with one specific suggestion for the next attempt. Sending requires an explicit button press. The browser does not receive agent API keys.

1. In BAND, create private Game Reporter and Run Analyst agents, then add both and your user to one room. Save the API keys when they are issued.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Set `BAND_ROOM_ID`, `BAND_REPORTER_API_KEY`, `ANALYST_AGENT_ID`, and `ANALYST_API_KEY` with values from your BAND account. `.env` is ignored by Git.
3. Run `npm run band:analyst` in a second terminal while `npm start` serves the game.
4. Finish a tournament run, press **Send run to BAND**, and check the room for the analyst response.

The analyst uses an authenticated local Codex CLI by default. Run `codex login status` to check it. To use an OpenAI Platform API key instead, set `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `BAND_MODEL` selects its model. The analyst worker needs to be running to answer new messages.

The local relay validates a small run summary, rate limits submissions, and serves only allowlisted game files. The summary includes outcome, fighter, difficulty, K.O.s, time, HP, chain, damage taken, and rank. This integration runs on the local Node server; static hosting serves the game but cannot run the relay. A public BAND deployment needs a secured backend and its own abuse controls.

## Watch AI Play

Choose **Watch AI Play**, pick a difficulty and fighter, and watch a BAND-connected model choose tactics in practice mode. The current tactic appears above the arena. Click **Take over**, press **T**, or use movement/attack controls to take control immediately. **Let AI play** hands the fighter back. Esc, gamepad Start, and touch pause still pause the fight.

Create a separate **BAND Player** agent and a private BAND room containing only you and that agent. Add these values to your ignored `.env`:

```dotenv
PLAYER_AGENT_ID=
PLAYER_API_KEY=
PLAYER_ROOM_ID=
# Optional: otherwise uses BAND_MODEL with OPENAI_API_KEY, or the signed-in Codex CLI.
PLAYER_MODEL=
```

Run `npm ci` and `npm start`; the game server starts the player runtime on demand. There is no separate player worker to launch. Existing reporter/analyst settings are independent. Tactic summaries appear in your private player room; watching sends small game observations to the configured model provider and uses its normal model allowance or API billing.

The model chooses a target, engage/retreat/Overclock, and when to use a charge finisher. A local controller executes normal movement, combos and reflex dodges at 60 Hz. It never changes health, damage, position or score directly. Decisions are requested at most once every eight seconds with one turn in flight. Tactics expire after 20 seconds; disconnected sessions expire after 30 seconds. Pause stops observation requests, and takeover discards pending decisions. Without a valid model tactic, the AI waits.

This first version plays practice with a model planner and local reflex controller. A single local spectator session owns control; another tab must wait or take over in the current tab. `?go=ai&char=saruabh` starts directly in this mode. BAND and model keys remain on the server. Static hosting cannot run this feature.

## Tournament

| Round | Area | Goal | Master |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Opening Court | 200 K.O.s | **Crane**: staff strikes and a floor storm |
| 2 | Inner Hall | 450 K.O.s | **Ox**: charges and shock waves |
| Semi-final | Dragon Ring | 700 K.O.s | **Viper**: falling attacks and reinforcements |
| Final | Dragon Ring | 1,000 K.O.s | **Dragon**: blade rushes, shadow copies, blackout, final form |

Red circles mark incoming area attacks. Leave the circle, dodge through the strike, or jump over travelling shock waves. Clearing a round heals you. Your team fights beside you.

| Fighter | Style | Overclock |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arick | Long range microphone and drone attacks | Sonic Boom |
| Saruabh | Fast selfie stick and laptop combos | Viral Storm |
| Vlad | Heavy cart attacks and camera flashes | Rush Hour |
| Connector | Hops, spins, and copied moves | Giga Connect |

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard / mouse | Gamepad | Touch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Move | WASD / arrows | Left stick | Left stick |
| Attack | J / left click | X / □ | ATK |
| Charge | K / right click | Y / △ | CHG |
| Jump | Space | A / × | JMP |
| Dodge | L / Shift | R1 / R2 | DDG |
| Overclock | I | B / ○ | OC |
| Camera | Mouse / Q / E | Right stick | Drag right side |
| Recenter | R | L1 / L2 | — |
| Pause | Esc | Start | II |

Tap attack for a combo. Press charge during a combo for a finisher, or use charge alone for a signature move. Every hit fills the Overclock gauge.

## Project layout and checks

- `index.html` and `src/ui/`: page, screens, HUD, and controls.
- `src/main.js`, `src/core/`, `src/hero/`, `src/chars/`, and `src/combat/`: game loop, fighters, and combat.
- `src/story/`, `src/world/`, and `src/crowd/`: tournament script, arena, and challengers.
- `serve.mjs` and `src/server/band.js`: local server and opt-in BAND relay.
- `agents/analyst.mjs`: BAND Run Analyst worker.
- `src/ai/`, `src/ui/ai-player.js`, and `src/server/player*.js`: AI observation, normal-input controller, takeover UI, sessions, and the on-demand BAND player runtime.

Run `npm test` for controller input, AI tactics/session ownership, tournament victory cleanup, relay, and server checks. A live analyst exchange requires account credentials and the analyst worker. `?go=story&char=saruabh` starts a tournament run directly; `?go=free` starts practice.
